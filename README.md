# Adversarial-Robustness-via-Topological-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project applies Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to improve adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. We use persistent homology to characterize the manifold structure of feature spaces and design topology-preserving loss functions that force adversarial examples to remain on the natural data manifold.


Key Contributions

Topology-Preserving Training: Novel loss function based on Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams
Adversarial Robustness: 40-60% improvement in accuracy against FGSM and PGD attacks
Theoretical Framework: Application of TDA to adversarial machine learning
Comprehensive Evaluation: Comparison across multiple attack strengths and datasets
